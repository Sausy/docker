# Known errors
There seems to be an error with the original stretch img from docker for ros
because a key is missing
```
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 3B4FE6ACC0B21F32
```
only with this key the command **apt-get update** works

!!! SOLUTION FUCKING CHANGE IMAGE FROM STRECH TO bionic


## Memory
Ros Base shall use entery as volumn to only have one rosbase image for all ros projects
